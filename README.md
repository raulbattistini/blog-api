# Project made with Node, Typescript, MySQL and TypeORM

>### First of all, I'd like to acknowledge a few things:
* Yes, MySQL has Sequelize, which requires less config 
* Yes, PostgreSQL is more robust (ending up being better for most usages)
* Yes, SQLite could be used for such a small purpose

But... 
* If you are on a budget (generally, MySQL hostings are cheaper than any other DBMSs, whether relational or not) and intend to scale up your project or
* If would like to bootstrap a sample project for MVP purposes real quick 

Then... MySQL can be your go-to RDBMS.

### About the project: 

Personally, I was finding it quite difficult to see a open repo or (free) course using those technologies, so I watched a series and created a repo myself ([see here](https://github.com/raulbattistini/microservices-exp)) last week and made a CRUD from it.


>* To get started, install `MySQL Workbench` (8.0 was used) if don't have it already, create a database named 'posts' and manage it with `Beekeeper Studio` to make it easier to run test queries and see results.

>* To test and debug requests, you can use whatever tool(s) you like (`Postman, Hoppscotch, Insomnia`)
